# Component Workflow

1) Develop your Astro component in src/components (you can add mocked data or perform step 2 first if this is preferred)
```text
/
└── src
    └── components
        └──example.astro
```
2) Create your models, check the [README.md](./models/README.md) in the models folder on how to do this
3) Create your mappings, check the [README.md](./mapping/README.md) in the mapping folder on how to do this. 

### Happy Coding :D
